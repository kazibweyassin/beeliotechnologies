# BEELIO TECHNOLOGIES - COLD EMAIL TEMPLATES

## Template 1: IT Support Services (Small Businesses)

**Subject:** Quick question about your IT setup

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] on [LinkedIn/Google/referral] and wanted to reach out.

Most businesses in Kampala lose 3-5 hours per week to IT issues - slow computers, email problems, network drops. That's UGX 500,000+ in lost productivity monthly.

We help companies like yours avoid these headaches with proactive IT management for less than the cost of one full-time tech person.

**What we handle:**
- 24/7 monitoring & support
- Regular system maintenance
- Email & network management
- Backup & security

**Quick question:** Are you currently happy with your IT support situation?

If not, I'd love to send you a 2-minute overview of how we work.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Template 3: Cloud Migration (Medium Businesses)

**Subject:** Still managing your own servers?

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How much are you spending monthly on server maintenance, power, and cooling?

Most businesses we talk to spend UGX 2-4M/month keeping on-premise servers running - plus the risk of data loss if something fails.

**We help companies migrate to cloud solutions that:**
- Cut infrastructure costs by 40-60%
- Provide 99.9% uptime (vs. typical 85-90%)
- Enable remote work for your team
- Scale up or down based on your needs

[Company Name] would likely save UGX 1-2M monthly while improving reliability.

**Would a 15-minute call make sense?** I can show you exactly how much you'd save.

Best,

## Template 4: Website & Software Development (All Businesses)

**Subject:** Your website could be generating more leads

Hi [First Name],

I was checking out [Company Name]'s website and noticed [specific observation: slow loading, not mobile-friendly, no contact form, etc.].

This might be costing you customers - 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load.

We build modern, fast websites that actually convert visitors to customers. Recent projects include [mention any relevant work].

**Quick question:** Are you getting as many inquiries from your website as you'd like?

If not, I'd be happy to send you a free website audit showing specific improvements that could boost your leads.

Let me know?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Template 5: Cybersecurity (All Businesses)

**Subject:** [Company Name]'s data security - a concern?

Hi [First Name],

With cybercrime on the rise in East Africa, I wanted to reach out.

Most small businesses think "we're too small to be targeted" - but 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses because they have weaker security.

**One breach could cost you:**
- Customer data loss
- Reputation damage
- Regulatory fines
- Business disruption

We offer affordable security audits (UGX 300,000) that identify vulnerabilities before hackers do.

**Would a brief security assessment interest you?**

## Template 6: NGO/Non-Profit Focused

**Subject:** IT support for non-profits - special rates

Dear [First Name],

I know [NGO Name] is doing important work in [their cause area], and I wanted to reach out about your IT needs.

Many NGOs struggle with limited IT budgets while needing reliable systems to serve their mission.

**We offer NGO-friendly rates on:**
- IT support & management
- Website development
- Cloud email & storage
- Network setup
- Staff training

We've worked with several NGOs in Kampala and understand your budget constraints.

**Can I send you our NGO pricing?** You might be surprised how affordable it is.
